### Desired Application Use and Results

1. User launches the app using the following command: landbank
2. The app will then scrape the data from the landbank website and make an API call to generate the geocodes
3. The app will then spawn a new window to display the visualization.
4. The geocoded addresses will be plotted on a map.
5. The user of the app should be able to click on the plots and view more details on each property
	- property details would include the address and possibly a link to street view.
